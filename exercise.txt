# Phase 1 - Coding

Our mates are looking for venues nearby our offices, foursquare is a service that allows searching for places given a location.
We would like to provide our mates with a function to query for venues given latitude and longitude.

Your task is to make that function, it should accept `lat`, `long` and return the list of venues that foursquare returns.
You can check the online resources that you want without copying the solution.

# Phase 2 - Coding extended

Our mates are now in a hurry and need to look for the closest venue on the list.
Your task now is to sort the list coming from foursquare by proximity to the input coordinates.
You can use the Euclidean distance (straight line) to compute the distance between points.
You can check documentation online for Euclidean distance.

# Phase 3 - Web Api

The function was a complete success and we want to make it available for all non-techie mates.
Your task now will be to expose the previously written function in an HTTP server that should respond in JSON with the list of venues given a pair of coordinates.

# Phase 4 - Scalability/Caching

Everyone is using your endpoint and sharing it with friends to find nearby venues.
Even though the function has been deployed into several instances we cannot handle the load and would like to create a caching mechanism.
What caching mechanism would you use?
Please implement it.
You are free to use the libraries you want.
